/**
  * This package contains the controller as well as the viewers
  * of the Pacman implementation.
  *
  * The viewers help to display the board, and a panel containing
  * the various buttons.
  *
  * The controllers rely on Swing to get user interaction, as well
  * as on controllers for moving monsters, and triggering animations.
  *
  * Since the Swing controllers are tightly integrated with the gui viewers,
  * we decided to keep controllers and viewers in a single package.
