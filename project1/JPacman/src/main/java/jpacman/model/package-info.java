/**
  * This package contains the pacman model: i.e., it contains representations
  * for cells, monsters, the player, the board, the game, etc.
  * The top level class is Engine, which keeps track of the state of the
  * game, and which implements the Facade design pattern -- offering
  * an interface to the controller classes.
